# KDJ
KDJ Stochastic Oscillator is a technical analysis tool developed by George Lane.
The KDJ is a momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s. Today, KDJ we introduce is slightly different from the first version. (The original Stochastic Oscillator just has two lines, K and D)

There are three lines that compose KDJ Stochastic Oscillator: K, D and J.
(4) Before calculating KDJ, we need to calculate RSV(Raw Stochastic Value) first.
