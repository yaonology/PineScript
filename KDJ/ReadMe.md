There are three lines that compose KDJ Stochastic Oscillator: K, D and J.
Before calculating KDJ, we need to calculate RSV(Raw Stochastic Value) first.

RSV equals close price minus lowest price in the past 9 period over highest price in the past period minus lowest price in the past 9 period
RSV = (Close price -
