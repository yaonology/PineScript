# 1.What is the KDJ Stochastic Oscillator?

KDJ Stochastic Oscillator is a technical analysis tool developed by George Lane.
The KDJ is a momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s. The original Stochastic Oscillator just has two lines, K and D. Today, KDJ we introduce is slightly different from the first version. There are three lines that compose KDJ Stochastic Oscillator: K, D and J. The J-line, in turn, represents the divergence of the D value from the K. The convergence of these lines will hint at emerging trading opportunities.

Before calculating KDJ, we need to calculate RSV(Raw Stochastic Value) first.

RSV equals close price minus lowest price in the past 9 period over highest price in the past period minus lowest price in the past 9 period

RSV = (Close price - Lowest price in the past 9 period)/(Highest price in 9 period - Lowest Price in 9 period)*100

K equals two-third of previous K value plus one-third rsv.

K = 2/3 * K[1] + 1/3 * RSV

D equals two-third of pervious D value plus one-third rsv.

D = 2/3 * D[1] + 1/3 * RSV

J equals 3 times K minus 2 times D.

J = 3 * K - 2 * D

# 2. What does the KDJ Stochastic Oscillator tell you? 

## · Momentum Concept

KD is the momentum indicator, K and D would be always between 0 and 100. J would be over the range of 0 to 100.

Here, we take an example. If the highest price in the past 9 bars is $50, close price is $36, and the lowest price in the past 9 bars is $20, rsv would be 53.33

Then, based on the rsv value, we can calculate K and D value

## · Overbought and Oversold

When the K and D value are both below 20, the stock price might be oversold. During the oversold area, if the K crossover D, it’s called gold cross, which means that the stock price is oversold and the stock price starts to rebound.

When the K and D value are both over 80, the stock price might be overbought. During the overbought area, if the K crossunder D, it’s called death cross, which means that the stock price is overbought and the stock price starts to turn down.

When the J is below 0, the stock price also might be oversold. During the oversold area, if the J crossover 0, it’s also means the golden-cross

When the K is over 100, the stock price might be overbought. During the overbought area, if the J crossunder 100, it’s also means the death-cross.

# 3. KDJ Stochastic Oscillator Strategy

## · KD Crossover and Crossunde

We can use the crosses to identify the best time to enter or exit the market. When we observe a gold cross when K and D are in oversold area, we buy the stock as the price will rebound soon. On the other hand, when we see a death cross in overbought area, we sell the stock as the price has reached it peak and will drop soon

Picture

## · J Crossover and Crossunder

We can also use J line to tell the oversold and overbought areas.
When J line is below 0, the stock is oversold; when the line is above 100, the stock is overbought.
When J crosses over 0 from below, we buy stock as the price will begin to rise soon; when J crosses 100 from above, we sell stock as the price will start to decrease.
