1. What is the KDJ Stochastic Oscillator?

KDJ Stochastic Oscillator is a technical analysis tool developed by George Lane.
The KDJ is a momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s. The original Stochastic Oscillator just has two lines, K and D. Today, KDJ we introduce is slightly different from the first version. There are three lines that compose KDJ Stochastic Oscillator: K, D and J. The J-line, in turn, represents the divergence of the D value from the K. The convergence of these lines will hint at emerging trading opportunities.

Before calculating KDJ, we need to calculate RSV(Raw Stochastic Value) first.

RSV equals close price minus lowest price in the past 9 period over highest price in the past period minus lowest price in the past 9 period

RSV = (Close price - Lowest price in the past 9 period)/(Highest price in 9 period - Lowest Price in 9 period)*100

K equals two-third of previous K value plus one-third rsv.

K = 2/3 * K[1] + 1/3 * RSV

D equals two-third of pervious D value plus one-third rsv.

D = 2/3 * D[1] + 1/3 * RSV

J equals 3 times K minus 2 times D.

J = 3 * K - 2 * D

2. What does the KDJ Stochastic Oscillator tell you? 
· Momentum Concept
KD is the momentum indicator, K and D would be always between 0 and 100. J would be over the range of 0 to 100.

Here, we take an example. If the highest price in the past 9 bars is $50, close price is $36, and the lowest price in the past 9 bars is $20, rsv would be 53.33

Then, based on the rsv value, we can calculate K and D value
