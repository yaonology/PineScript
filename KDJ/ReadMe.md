1. What is the KDJ Stochastic Oscillator?

KDJ Stochastic Oscillator is a technical analysis tool developed by George Lane.
The KDJ is a momentum indicator, first developed in the 1950s. Today, KDJ we introduce is slightly different from the first version. (The original Stochastic Oscillator just has two lines, K and D)

There are three lines that compose KDJ Stochastic Oscillator: K, D and J.
Before calculating KDJ, we need to calculate RSV(Raw Stochastic Value) first.

RSV equals close price minus lowest price in the past 9 period over highest price in the past period minus lowest price in the past 9 period
RSV = (Close price - Lowest price in the past 9 period)/(Highest price in 9 period - Lowest Price in 9 period)*100

K equals two-third of previous K value plus one-third rsv.
K = 2/3 * K[1] + 1/3 * RSV

D equals two-third of pervious D value plus one-third rsv.
D = 2/3 * D[1] + 1/3 * RSV

J equals 3 times K minus 2 times D.
J = 3 * K - 2 * D
